# FindMyRoomie
<p align = "justify">
<b>FindMyRoomie</b> is a Web Application that provides a platform for lonely wolves (NC State students) to find roommates of their preference. The stakes are high when it comes to finding your best roommate because this relationship starts with a living relationship :sweat_smile:. We understand how stressful this can be, especially if you are moving to a new city or country. FindMyRoomie is a one-stop solution to your roommate finding needs. Our software has functionalities that allow you to filter and choose your ideal roommate. But if that is too much work for you, we also provide roommate suggestions based on your preferences! Any <b> NC State student </b> could sign up with their NC State Email address from any corner of the world on our website and begin searching for roommates.

The "Visibility" checkbox in your profile allows you to choose whether you want to be visible to others. If you are looking for roommates, you can toggle it on, and if you have found one (Congratulations :partying_face: :partying_face:), you can toggle it off. It's that easy!

## Steps to set up the project on your local machine

#### 1. Clone the repository:  

   `git clone https://github.com/rohitgeddam/FindMyRoomie.git`

#### 2. Setup the virtual environment:  
    
    `python -m venv venv`

#### 3. Activate the virtual environment:  

    * On Mac/Linux:    
    
      `source venv/bin/activate`
      
    * On Windows:    
    
      `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
#### 3. Install required modules and libraries:  

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 4. Create .env file at ./src/config/
   <p align = "justify">
   To setup Gmail to send emails to users, first create a new Gmail account. Under 'Manage your Google Account', enable 2-Step Verification and select suitable app and device under 'App passwords'. Copy the key that is generated and paste it under tha EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD. Enter the email in EMAIL_HOST_USER.
   </p>
   Paste this in the .env file.
   
```
SECRET_KEY=@dr11(7h4n=#@8juk63y(-#bqicdl$9f2okpr@#564=a+-f&*8
DEBUG=True
EMAIL_BACKEND="django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
```
Fill the above field and save.

#### 5. Run the application:  
   
   ```
   cd src 
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
  
## After adding another field to Model
Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Populate fake data for testing

```
python manage.py seed_users <number of fake instances>

# creates ten fake users
python manage.py seed_users 10
```

## Automatic tools - GitHub Actions
 
We use GitHub actions to automate tasks of linting, code coverage, build, tests, and security checks. The codes that perform these actions are stored as `.yml` files in the `.github/workflows` directory. The GitHub actions are triggered whenever something is pushed (or pulled) into the remote repository. The results of these automated tasks are shown as badges at the top of this README.md file. 

### Unit tests:

Unit test are performed everytime there is a push or pull into the repository. For more information about Unit test visit [Test README](https://github.com/rohitgeddam/FindMyRoomie/blob/main/src/tests/README.md)

### How to build docs
`sphinx-build -b html docs/  docs/build `

### Code Coverage: 

Code Coverage is an important metric that allows us to understand how much of the codebase is tested. `Code_Cov.yml` performs this task. For more information about Code Coverage, please visit this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage). 

### Flake8 - Code Linting:

We are using Flake8 for linting and syntax checking, and it is performed by `Linting.yml`. For more information about Flake8, please visit this [link](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2).
Use flake8 before you push code to GitHub. </br>
Config file present in `setup.cfg`.

```
flake8 <directory>
```

### Black - Code Formatter

We are using the Black code formatter to format our code before pushing it to GitHub. For more information about Black, please visit this [link](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


Run the line below everytime you push to GitHub.</br>
Config file present in `pyproject.toml`
```
black --line-length 120 <filename>
```

If you prefer using Black in VSCode, you can add the below settings in your vscode settings:

```
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "120"],
    "python.linting.enabled": true
}
```
  
### Pre Commit Hooks for Black Code formatting and Flake8 Linting
* run  `pre-commit install`
* Now everytime you commit, Black and Flake8 will run automatically and will not allow you to push if the code standards are not met.

### CodeQL

`CodeQL.yml` performs automated security checks on the codebase and scans it for any vulnerabilities and bugs. For more information about CodeQL, please visit this [link](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/).

## Roadmap

### 3 months milestone:

1. Include apartment details in the profile section. The details could include (but are not restricted to) the address of the apartment, the apartment BHK and size, and rent. Users who have already secured a property and are looking for roommates to occupy them could use this functionality.
2. Provide an update for the 'My Room' page, giving users the option to include and display their finalized roommates.
3. Create a platform within the website that allows homeowners to lease or sublease their apartments.
4. Suggest properties based on user filters by scraping it from the web and update the matching algorithm.
5. Implement a chat room that allows users to chat with one another in-webapp. 

### 6 months milestone:

6. Create a mobile application and publish it on App Store and Google Play Store
7. Implement a subleasing option.
8. Improve the matching algorithm.

### 9 months milestone:

8. Partner with local property agents like Wilson Properties, Trinity Properties, etc. to list their properties on our website.
