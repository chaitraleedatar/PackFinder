========================================
Welcome to FindMyRoomie's documentation!
========================================

FindMyRoomie is a Web Application that provides a platform for lonely wolves (**NC State students**) to find roommates of their preference. 
The stakes are high when it comes to finding your best roommate because this relationship starts with a living relationship ðŸ˜….
We understand how stressful this can be, especially if you are moving to a new city or country. 
FindMyRoomie is a one-stop solution to your roommate finding needs. Our software has functionalities that allow you to filter and choose your ideal roommate. 
But if that is too much work for you, we also provide roommate suggestions based on your preferences! 
Any NC State student could sign up with their NC State Email address from any corner of the world on our website and begin searching for roommates.
